# Google search results counter
This is simple Java application.
Its main purpose is to display total count of Google search query.
There are two modes:
* you can put Google search link (ex. https://www.google.com/search?q=java+jsoup)
* you can put words for Google search query (ex. "java jsoup")

Jsoup is used for Google search page parsing.
